# Augmented Normalizing Flows on Homogenous Spaces

Notes:
- differentiating through axis-angle to rotation conversion
- what's the difference between preceprocessing and inference proprocessing

Todos:
- finish debugging training + coupling layers
- further prune train.py, getting rid of unncessary arguments
- redesign ScoreModel (horrendous right now, but doesn't need to be super complex)
- check invertibility of flow layers + right script to check?
