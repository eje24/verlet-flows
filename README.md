# Augmented Normalizing Flows on Homogenous Spaces

Notes:
- differentiating through axis-angle to rotation conversion
- what's the difference between preceprocessing and inference_proprocessing

Todos:
- add in inference epochs (but need to think more about how this should be done: rmsd?)
- no need for RDKit structures in pdbbind.py
- finish randomize position + sampling stuff
